### 4. Implemented URL Redirects
**Issue:** Old site URLs would result in 404 errors
**Solution:** Added 15 permanent redirects for SEO continuity

**Files Modified:**
- `next.config.ts` (line 66-161)

**Redirects Implemented:**
| Old URL | New URL |
|---------|---------|
| `/leverantorer-event` | `/en/find-suppliers` |
| `/smmp` | `/en/strategic-meeting-management` |
| `/for-business-travel-agencies` | `/en/travel-agencies` |

**Result:** All legacy URLs now redirect properly, preserving SEO rankings

### 5. Hero Section Redesign

- Social proof customer logos
- CSS-only animations (no WebGL)
