# Three.js Globe Animation Status

## Overview
The Event Logic homepage features an interactive 3D globe animation built with Three.js that visualizes the global reach of the event management platform.

## Current Implementation

### Active Version: `WorldSphereAnimation.tsx`
- **Globe**: Purple wireframe sphere (Event Logic brand color)
- **Destinations**: 20 major cities marked with pulsing purple dots
- **Connections**: Purple arcs connecting cities
- **Animation**: White glowing spheres with purple halos traveling along arcs
- **Interaction**: Mouse movement controls camera position
- **Rotation**: Continuous slow rotation
- **Size**: Radius of 12 units (desktop) / 10 units (mobile)

### Key Features
1. Responsive design with mobile optimization
2. Smooth performance with proper cleanup
3. Real latitude/longitude coordinates for cities
4. Fade in/out effects for traveling light beams
5. Container-aware sizing (adapts to parent element)

## Available Versions

### 1. `WorldSphereAnimation.tsx` (Active)
The current production version with purple branding and white light beams.

### 2. `WorldSphereAnimationV1.tsx`
Backup of the original implementation with slightly larger globe and different beam spacing.

### 3. `WorldSphereAnimationV2.tsx` 
Experimental version featuring:
- Purple wireframe globe
- Orange event dots and connections
- Orange dashed line animation (similar to flight tracking visualizations)

### 4. `ThreeGlobeAnimation.tsx`
Alternative implementation inspired by three-globe library:
- Dark blue Earth-like appearance with atmosphere
- Orange event markers
- Orange light beams with tail effects
- OrbitControls for user interaction

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "three": "^0.160.0"
}
```

### File Structure
```
src/components/
├── WorldSphereAnimation.tsx      # Active version
├── WorldSphereAnimationV1.tsx    # Original backup
├── WorldSphereAnimationV2.tsx    # Orange variant
├── ThreeGlobeAnimation.tsx       # Earth-like variant
└── HeroSection.tsx              # Parent component
```

### Performance Considerations
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation
- Proper disposal of Three.js objects on unmount
- Reduced particle count on mobile devices
- Optimized geometry complexity

## Switching Between Versions

To change the active animation, update the import in `HeroSection.tsx`:

```typescript
// Current (purple with white beams)
import WorldSphereAnimation from './WorldSphereAnimation';

// Orange variant
import WorldSphereAnimationV2 from './WorldSphereAnimationV2';

// Earth-like appearance
import ThreeGlobeAnimation from './ThreeGlobeAnimation';
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Three-globe Integration**: The `ThreeGlobeAnimation.tsx` is prepared for integration with the three-globe library, which would provide:
   - Real Earth textures
   - More sophisticated arc animations
   - Built-in interaction handlers
   - Country borders and labels

2. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Consider implementing LOD (Level of Detail) for better mobile performance
   - Add WebGL capability detection with fallback

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Connect to real event data API
   - Show actual event locations
   - Display live connection data

4. **Customization Options**:
   - Make colors configurable via props
   - Allow toggling animation features
   - Add zoom controls for mobile
